# library-odoo12-project-final

A project in Odoo12 for learning basics of development in this environment.

This is a small project of manage a library, project for learning Odoo develpment essentials course of 10 units or tittles

4 modules:

1 - **library_app** => main module = main app => with the main menu and interfaz of the project in odoo backend

    Will be 4 versions/iterations over this module (To explain several concepts: structure of module, data, models...)

            v01 => 1st iteration [T02] = creation from zero of "Module Structure"

            v02 => 2nd iteration [T04] = include/add more "Data"

            v03 => 3rd iteration [T05] = include/add more "Models"

            v04 => 4th iteration / Last commit [T08] = Finnish the project

2 - **library_member** => extra module = extra app => for extra functionality to manage members of the library in odoo backend

    Will be just 1 version/iteration over this module (Just to explain inherit in Odoo)

            v01 => 1st iteration [T03] = extends functionality in odoo / inherit

3 - **library_checkout** => extra module = extra app => for extra functionality to manage checkouts of library books in odoo backend

    Will be 3 versions/iterations over this module (To explain several concepts: ORM, Views, Qweb Reports...)

            v01 => 1st iteration [T07] = ORM, Controllers

            v02 => 2nd iteration [T06] = Views

            v03 => 3rd iteration [T08] = Qweb Reports (Note: this affects to main module app to include a new menu option/action)

4 - **library_website** => extra module = extra app => for first aproximation to odoo frontend            

    Will be just 1 version/iteration over this module (Just to explain/show concepts of odoo frontend)

            v01 => 1st iteration [T05,T06,T07,T09] = Models, Views, Controllers, External API
